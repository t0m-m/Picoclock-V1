# Picoclock-V1
Simple little desktop clock based on Raspberry Pi Pico on custom PCB
# Information
This version of the clock is only made for testing purposes. The final version will feature vintage V!B-71 7 segment displays. However everything else apart from the displays is the same and will be featured in the final version. 
On board is DS3231 RTC chip, as well as a buzzer and 4 buttons for controls, such as brightness, confirm, cancel and mode. 

There is no on-board battery, so the unit must be connected to external power supply using Pico's micro USB port. The final version may feature Li-on pack however.
# Implemented features
* Time Keeping
* Date Mode
* Alarm Mode
# Hardware
I am designing the board in Altium Designer, on two layer PCB, as shown below.
