#Picoclock-V1

A simple desktop clock built around the Raspberry Pi Pico and a custom PCB.

#Overview

Picoclock-V1 is an experimental prototype designed for testing and feature validation.
The final version will showcase vintage VQB-71 7-segment displays, but all other components and circuitry will remain the same.

The board includes:

DS3231 high-accuracy real-time clock

MAX7221 display driver

Buzzer for alarm/notifications

Four control buttons for brightness, confirm, cancel, and mode selection

Currently, the unit does not include an onboard battery and requires external power via the Picoâ€™s micro-USB port.
A future revision may include a Li-ion battery pack for standalone operation.

#Implemented Features

*Time keeping

*Date display mode

*Alarm mode

*Hardware

Initially planned as a 2-layer PCB, the design evolved into a 4-layer board for cleaner signal routing and improved performance.
The board also includes four 3 mm mounting holes for attaching a plexiglass cover or securing the unit in place.

#Notes

This version focuses on functionality and layout validation. The next iteration will aim for improved aesthetics, enclosure design, and power management.
